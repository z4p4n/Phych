Tool for detecting a fish in his aquarium

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z4p4n/Phych/master/img/aquarium.png)

Prerequisites
------

Phych requires OpenCV 2.4.x and Curl libraries


How to compile
------

```
	make
```

How it works
------

I bought two used cameras 'Heden Cloud v5.5' (I got these shits for 10$ !!) that I sniff for understanding the protocols. 
These cameras can rotate vertically and horizontally, record and broadcast sound and have an infrared vision.
I use Background Subtraction Methods in order to locate Phych movement. Next I locate randomly a white pixel and bruteforce and small rectangle around the white pixel to get the entire Fish. Flood fill is not good enough in these case due to noise generated by the background substraction methods. I don't use 'find contours' methods from OpenCV, because bruteforce is just faster.
